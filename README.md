## About

This is my diploma project called Asq. It's an app that translates queries in Russian language into SQL queries.
The server file is modules/server.py, it can be started with the following command:
```bash
waitress-serve --port=8000 server:app
```

The repository for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/Ruminat/Asq-App).
